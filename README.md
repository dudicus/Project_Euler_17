# Project_Euler_17

My solution for problem 17 from projecteuler.net...

Program takes the numbers 1 to 1000, translates each number into it's string equivalent (i.e. 457 = "four hundred and fifty seven"),
and stores it in an array.  The array is then joined into one string and non-alpha characters are removed. The length of the string
is printed to show how many total letters there are.
